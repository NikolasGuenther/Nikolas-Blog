      <h2>SUPERDIVERSITY-BLESSING OR CURSE?</h2>
      <p>Today many immigrants are coming from different countries to Europe and bring their culture, language and faith. This creates a big diversity in our society. If this diversity gets extreme it’s called “Superdiversity”. The term “Superdiversity” was introduced by the sociologist Steven Vertovec in 2007. It describes the new kind of complex diversity in our modern society, especially in cities. This kind of 	diversity is in the eyes of some people a curse because the believe it will take their traditions other see a blessing in this kind of diversity because they think it would create more strong economy and mor innovations. Is the “Superdiversity” a blessing or a curs to our society?<p>
<p> <p>
<p>A big disadvantage is the risk of parallel society and fragmentation. <p>
<p>The big difference in the culture in a society could split it in many ways for example in questions about when holidays should be, due to different celebrations in the different cultures. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation notes that while diversity is positive it can lead to conflicts if not managed through effective integration politic.<p>
<p>Another aspect is, that social tensions would raise, and it would lead to a rise of political polarisation.<p> 
<p>Many people think that immigrants take their money because the state invests steers in their integration and accommodation. The European Council´s report on populism discusses how immigration policies are challenged by populist movements questioning liberal values and potential increasing societal division.<p>
<p>But it could also insure tolerance and human rights awareness. <p>
<p>Because the if people live in a diverse society, they get more normal about cultural or other aspects of the other people and be mor tolerant. Pew Research centre reports that majorities across political lines in the USA view racial and ethnic diversity positively, indicating a trend toward greater acceptance and equality.<p>
<p>Another advantage is, that the economy will be stronger and there will be more innovations.<p>
<p>Immigrants can fill job gaps or found new companies. A diverse society brings more diverse innovations. McKinsey & Company found that companies in the top quartile for ethnic diversity are 27% more likely to have superior financial performance.<p>
<p><p>
<p>To sum it up there are many advantages the superdiversity creates but it also creates some problems we have to threat with, but they could be solved and that’s why I think that Super diversity is a blessing to our society.<p>
